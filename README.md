## 🚀 About This Project

Welcome to the **NoCode AI Tool Directory**!  
This is a community-driven, open-source collection of AI-powered tools that **don't require code to use** — perfect for indie hackers, designers, entrepreneurs, and anyone who loves to build without code.

Whether you're building content, automating workflows, or generating images, this repo has you covered.

## 🛠 How It Works

All tools are listed directly in this README (for now) and categorized by type.  
We’ll later expand to a proper website via GitHub Pages or a platform like Framer or Webflow.
